# PAN-1-CrackMe
<b>What is this?</b>
A Crack Me designed to wreck your mind. It is intended for security researchers and beginner security researchers.

<b>How to play?</b>
You must know how to reverse engineer binaries. This is a crack me designed for security research beginners.
The idea is simple. The program accepts only ONE username as a login, the username is hard-coded inside the program for easiness. (Or maybe not). You can even patch branches if you feel like doing that, but I would feel proud if someone would tweet me the actual username.

The algorithm is dead simple, and I can give you only 1 piece of advice: "You've got to think about big things while you're doing small things, so that all the small things go in the right direction." - Alvin Toffler

<b>Who made this?</b>
